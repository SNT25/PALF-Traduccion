#pick whether you're going to perform or switch out

#if you pick perform
    # pick what sort of performance you want to make (audio/visual/props)

    # pick which move you want your pokemon to use (one/of/four/moves)

#if you pick switch out
    # pick which pokemon you're going to switch out to

#once your move is planned, it's put into the action queue.

#then the action queue is iterated through, and points are tallied and recorded
    #if a performer hits a jackpot, then the performer may get extra points
    #'jamming' effects also happen here 

#at the end of the turn, final point totals are tallied, and the order of the action queue is decided for the next turn. (Low-performers perform later. Performing later is a better position, as you can't be 'jammed', and know what roles previous actors are going to take.)
    #animate this, with characters acting happily if they 'moved up' in rank, and poorly if they 'moved down'
