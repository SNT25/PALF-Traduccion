leaf @closedbrow talkingmouth "Yeah, it wasn't pretty. But my family lived right on the shore, in a laboratory. We gathered up our PokÃ©mon, helped our neighbors evacuate, and were miles away by the time the lava started flowing."

leaf @angrybrow angrymouth "Well, sorry to disappoint. Dickhead."

red @talking2mouth "On a serious note, though, you said you lived in a laboratory?"

red @talkingmouth "Yeah, exactly like that. Obnoxious and loud-mouthed. Anyway, I did the exact same thing."
