    fantina surprised "'What? No!' doctor cried. 'This is unjust! I have tried to do good thing, but I will soonly die!'"
    fantina norm3 "'You tried to cheat death,' spirit told him. 'But I will give you one last chance. Here is a brand new candle. If you transfer your failing flame to this one, it will last you many years."
