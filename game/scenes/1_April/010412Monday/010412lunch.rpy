redmind uniform @thinking "Alright. Alder said that I could use my lunch times to study."
redmind @thinking "Maybe instead of just chatting with everyone, I should see if I can invite someone specific to help me study."
redmind @surprised "Oh, wait... there's that one teacher Ethan knows, Professor Cherry, right? I think I've seen her at lunch a few times."
redmind @thinking "Maybe I could ask her to help out. I bet having a Professor help me would be even more effective than studying with another student."
