    alder @spunky2 "Ah... this is going to be a bit awkward, but I actually think hiding your power is a perfectly fine strategy." 
    alder @norm2 "If you mislead your opponent a bit, well, it's fine if you do that {i}during{/i} the battle, so why not before? I do it all the time."

    bruno @norm2 "It's dishonorable when you do it, too."

    alder @happy2 "Hah! Bruno and I've been good friends for many years, but we don't agree on everything."

    alder @norm2 "Since we can't agree what we should be teaching here, I hope the lesson you learn is that everyone has different ideas of what a 'good victory,' or a 'good loss' are."

    whitney frownmouth @talking2mouth "Oh... okay."
