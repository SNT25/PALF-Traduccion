whitney @talking2mouth "Who're you looking for?"

red @closedbrow talking2mouth "Um... brown hair, olive skin."
red @happy "Even shorter than you."

whitney @happy "Hey! I may be short, but that just means I'm {i}dense!{/i} Lots of power packed in a small frame."

red @talkingmouth "Don't think I've ever heard someone claim to be dense so pridefully."

whitney @talking2mouth "Well, there's a first time for everything."
whitney @surprised "Oh, wait, there! I don't recognize her, so that must be our girl!"

narrator "About ten minutes pass before Tia shows any signs of slowing down. You watch, bemusedly, as the two tiny women gyrate around, having a loud, animated, conversation without making a sound."

whitney sad "I can't... keep up... when was the last time you had a conversation, geez? My hands are going to be {i}so{/i} sore..."

red @talking2mouth "Uh... don't mean to interrupt, but can I get the gist?"

show tia at rightside

whitney @surprised "The gist is this girl has had a sucky day. She hit a meteor, and got super-tired?" 
whitney @surprised "Then she was abducted and brought here, then you abandoned her? And then she couldn't find her way to her classes, and has just been hiding in abandoned classrooms since this morning?"
whitney -sad @sadbrow talkingmouth "I'm probably mis-translating some of that..."

narrator "Tia shakes her head. Whitney does not notice."

red @sad "Ah, geez. I'm really sorry about that, Tia. I told you how to sign up for electives, but didn't tell you how to get to them, did I? Bonehead move on my part. Sorry."

whitney @closedbrow talkingmouth "Tia? Is that your name?"

narrator "Tia quickly shakes her head and begins signing something new."

whitney @talking2mouth "B-I-A-N-C-A? Oh, Bianca! So that's why you asked, [first_name]. V-O-N-G-O-L-E?"
whitney @happy "Wait... Bianca Vongole? Oh my god, dormie! You were supposed to be the fifth person in our room, but you never showed up!"
whitney @surprised "What happened? How come you were so late to school? It's been almost two weeks!"

narrator "Bianca looks at you, then at Whitney, then at you... and shrugs."

whitney @surprised "...Uh. You don't know?"

narrator "Tia nods."

whitney angrybrow frownmouth @angry "How can you {i}not know?{/i}"

red @happy "Hey. Maybe we should just leave that alone. You know, maybe she didn't even say 'I don't know'? It might be a mistranslation."

whitney @talking2mouth "Okay, what aren't you telling me?"

red @surprised "Huh?"

whitney @talking2mouth "You called her Tia. And she's suddenly showing up almost two weeks after school begins, telling wild stories about meteors and kidnapping?"
whitney @closedbrow talkingmouth "There's something fishy going on here."

red @surprised "I, uh... I can't tell you. I mean, I don't even really know. But if I'm going to figure it out, you're probably going to as well. After all, I'll need you to translate."

whitney @closedbrow talkingmouth "Hrm. It's good to keep my signing in-practice, but if I'm going to third wheel for you and Bianca, I'm going to need you to do something for me."

red @happy "Of course. Anything."
red @closedbrow talking2mouth "I mean, within reason."

whitney -frownmouth @happy "Heeheeheehee! You totally owe me now."

red @confusedeyebrows talking2mouth "Uh... what do I owe you?"

whitney @happy "Everything. But I'll tell you, specifically, what you owe me later."

tia "Hi! I'm so glad we can finally talk for real. Well, with Whitney's help."

red @talkingmouth "Woah, this is kind of a weird experience, talking through someone like this... wait, are you translating this, too? She isn't deaf."

whitney @closedbrow talkingmouth "When you're signing for someone else, you just translate everything you hear. It takes more time to turn off the part of your brain that does the conversion."

red @closedbrow talking2mouth "Oh, so it's a mindless activity? Maybe I could learn to do it, too, then!"

tia @happy "Hah hah! You're so funny, [first_name]!"

red @happy "Uh... thanks, Bianca."

tia @closedeyes talking2mouth "You can call me Tia in front of Whitney, it's alright. She's a good person, so I don't need to hide myself."

red @happy "Um... are you hiding from someone, then? I kinda got that vibe..."

tia sadeyes sadeyebrows frownmouth @sadmouth "Yes."

red @closedbrow talking2mouth "Who?"

narrator "Tia sneaks a glance at Whitney, who is studiously signing, not a glimmer of recognition or acknowledgement of the strangeness of the conversation present on her face."

tia @sadmouth "A bad person."

red @talkingmouth "...Do you know who this bad person is?"

tia @sadmouth "No. But they're somewhere around here. I can smell them."

red @closedbrow talking2mouth "...Uh, Whitney? Want to double-check that one?"

whitney @closedbrow talkingmouth "I'm... pretty sure I read that correctly. She definitely signed 'smell.'"

red @talkingmouth "Can we stop this 'bad person' by going to the police?"

tia @thinking "No."

red @sad "Are you sure? If you're in danger, they can help."

tia @sadeyes sadeyebrows "I don't think they can. It's best if I just hide. I don't want anyone to know I'm here."

red @talking2mouth "Well... I won't tell anyone, then. But your dormmates will know."

tia @thinking "[ellipses]"

red @talkingmouth "What's she signing?"

whitney @angry "Nothing! She's just thinking. Would you stop backseating my interpretations?"

red @surprised "Oops, sorry."

tia @thinking "I {w=0.5}think {w=1.0}that's fine."
