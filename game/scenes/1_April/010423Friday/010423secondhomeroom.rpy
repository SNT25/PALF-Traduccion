janine @closedbrow talkingmouth "But raw power hasn't been working out. So maybe my Dad had a point after all. I don't know. But this is the last year I've got to figure it out. Because, no matter what, we're placing in the National Tournament this year."

janine @talking2mouth "The strategy here is just about how to stagger our sign-ups so it's least likely that any of us get matched up against each other."
janine @closedbrow talkingmouth "Previous years have figured out that if we sign up exactly thirty-one minutes after one another, we're fourty-four percent less likely to end up in battles against each other in the third Quarter Qlash."
