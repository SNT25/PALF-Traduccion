alder @closedbrow talking2mouth"...But spamming Full Restores won't make you a Champion, no matter how many of them you have."

bruno @angry2 "Using healing items in battle is the weak man's substitute for resilience."

alder @talking2mouth "Can't say I agree, but there's other reasons not to. A Full Restore might buy your Pokémon a couple of seconds of health, but since they need to stay still for you to apply the medicine..."
alder @happy2 "Any competent opponent's going to use that opening to buff themselves, so they can knock you out in {i}one{/i} shot next time, which means you just blew three thousand bucks to give your opponent an opening."

gardenia uniform @happy "Alder, Sir!"

alder @talking2mouth "Oh, right, Gardenia! I actually meant to talk to you about that, uh... what was it you sold me again? Common candies?"

gardenia @surprisedbrow talkingmouth "{i}All sales are final.{/i}"
gardenia @talking2mouth "But I have a question for {i}you.{/i} You said that spamming Full Restores isn't a good idea because of the cost... but aren't Champions like you {i}extremely{/i} well-paid?"

alder @happy2 "Oh, I don't want to toot my own horn. But I {i}am{/i} able to keep a pretty nice house in the The Gray Natural Research Center, where my daughter and grandson live."
alder @talking2mouth "The Unovan government makes sure its Champions are well-taken care of."
alder @closedbrow talking2mouth "Actually, every single year I was reigning, Congress voted to increase my salary, as part of the defense budget."
alder @happy2 "Don't know what they thought {i}this{/i} old geezer could defend them from. I couldn't even defend them from a little girl!"

gardenia @talking2mouth "Okay... Unovan Champion... very well paid. Noted. What about the Kantonian Champion, Instructor Bruno? You must know, since you work under Lance."

bruno @sad2 "Lance is not the sort of man who shares his financial information."
bruno @norm2 "However, the Indigo Champion has the combined salaries of both the former Kantonian and Johtonian champions."
bruno @think2 "One can assume that he is very well paid. Though... perhaps still not to the degree that Alder is."

leaf uniform @angry "{size=30}I {i}knew{/i} he was lying about being a teacher for the money!{/size}"

alder @talking2mouth "I think I heard... yeah, the Paldean Champion gets $2000 a month, I think. So $24k a year."

gardenia @surprised "What? That's {i}so{/i} low! How do they not starve to death?"

grusha uniform @talkingmouth "{i}Esperar.{/i} Paldea has many Champions--ninety-seven, right now. In Paldea, Champion is a rank you attain, not a job a single person has."

pause 1.0

misty uniform @closedbrow talking2mouth "Well, that's dumb."

grusha @confusedeyebrows talking2mouth "I can think of ninety-seven people who might disagree with you."
grusha @closedbrow talking2mouth "Anyway, we also have a 'Top Champion'--La Primera--but she doesn't accept the allowance. It's tradition for the Top Champion not to."

raihan uniform @surprised "Hold on, now. So this... 'top Champion' is, like, your {i}actual{/i} Champion? And you've got ninety-seven Elite Four?"

grusha @playfulbrow talking2mouth "Yes. And you need to beat them all in a row to challenge the Champion."

raihan @closedbrow talking2mouth "Mad."

nessa uniform @sad "Raihan, he's messing with you."

raihan @surprised "What?!"

raihan @surprised "He's a guy?!"

gardenia @talkingmouth "Hey, hey, back on track, please! What can you tell us about the other Champions' salaries?"

alder @talking2mouth "Hm... I think Steven Stone abolished the Champion's pay when he became Champion. Though I heard the salary wasn't very big, anyway."
alder @happy2 "Of course, being the heir to Devon, he didn't need it. And Instructor Wallace was already filthy rich from endorsements and contest prizes when he became Champion."

bruno @norm2 "Do you not know how much the Champion of Sinnoh is paid?"

gardenia @happy "Oh, no, I know that one."
gardenia @talkingmouth "Cynthia is paid one point one one eight billion a year. Though this amount fluctuates based on market conditions."

sonia uniform @sadbrow talking2mouth "What does she even do with that much money...?"

gardenia @talkingmouth "Uh... no-one knows."
gardenia @surprisedbrow talking2mouth "I've studied the economies of Celestic Town and the area north of route 223 so I could figure out what she was spending her money on, and invest in it..."
gardenia @surprised "But as far as I can tell, she's either not spending that money at all, or does all her shopping online!"

nessa @talking2mouth "Being fair, it's rather hard to imagine Cynthia walking into a Poké Mart and asking to buy a handful of Poké Balls."

gardenia @talking2mouth "Yeah, I guess..."

$ PlaySound("idea.ogg")

gardenia @surprisedbrow frownmouth "!"

gardenia @angrybrow happymouth "So what does your dear friend Leon spend his money on, {i}Raihan?{/i} I've seen those Gigantamax-sized checks they wheel out for him!"

raihan @closedbrow talking2mouth "Ah... somehow, he spends that money even faster than he gets it. He helps out trainers in Galar, mostly, but sometimes he'll just decide to buy an island, or bankroll a new field of science..."

nessa @talking2mouth "The Aether Foundation has three new wings named after him. Don't think he even knows how to pronounce 'aether.'"

raihan @surprised "Being fair, it's a bloody tough word. Who decided 'ae' should be pronounced 'ee'? It should be, like... 'eye-ee.' Or maybe 'ey'?"

nessa @talking2mouth "...Sunny, this is your daily reminder you're the smart one."

sonia @sadbrow talkingmouth "Er... thanks, Ness."

alder @happy2 "Alright, alright. The point is, every Champion makes a comfortable living."
alder @talkingmouth "Although... just to make sure I'm getting this right... Cynthia's $1.1 billion is a lot?"

gardenia @surprised "Huh? Yeah, of course! It's an absolutely {i}massive{/i} amount of money!"

alder @closedbrow talking2mouth "...Huh. Guess I haven't gone shopping in a while."

redmind uniform @surprised "Wait... he didn't realize that was a ton of money? Just how wealthy is he?!"

bruno @norm2 "Let's move onto the battles now. We've talked long enough."

    red @sadbrow talkingmouth "Aw, don't be worried about that. I don't know much about contests, but I thought you were awesome. Really stylish and classy."

    serena @sad "A kind sentiment, but the judges will be individuals who {i}do{/i} know a lot about contests."

    red @sadbrow talkingmouth "Aw, you're going to do the whole thing without me."
