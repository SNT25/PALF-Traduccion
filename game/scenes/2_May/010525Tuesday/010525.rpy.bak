red @talkingmouth "Noticed you and Ethan weren't there for game night last night. That's two weeks we've missed it, right?"

redmind @thinking "Hm. Maybe Blue and Leaf actually {i}do{/i} have something in common."

yellow @closedbrow talkingmouth "Yes... I went to bed early."
yellow @sad2eyes talkingmouth "I was watching a Coordinator club meeting. It went a bit long... and I didn't want to risk leaving while Lisia was training the coordinators, in case she thought I {i}was{/i} one, trying to escape."

red @happy "I heard she can get pretty intense."
red @talkingmouth "But I didn't know you were interested in Coordinating."

yellow @talkingmouth "I'm not, really. I was just looking for something to do."
yellow @sad2eyes talkingmouth "Normally, I spend my evenings with Blue, but... since we weren't talking..."
yellow @talkingmouth "Well, I wandered all over the school until I found the coordinators."

red @talking2mouth "Think you might try out?"

yellow @surprised "N-no! Definitely not!"
yellow @happy "They're all so pretty and graceful and confident. I wouldn't last a second in the ring with them."
yellow @blush sad2eyes sadeyebrows happymouth "Besides, the outfits the coordinators wear... they're a bit much for me."

red @talkingmouth "Hey, never know 'til you try."
red @closedbrow talking2mouth "So the Coordinator Club holds its meetings on Mondays?"

yellow @talkingmouth "Not usually. But Lisia's been holding a lot of extra meetings. There's a big contest coming up, and Lisia wants to make sure the Coordinator Club puts on the best show they can."
yellow @closedbrow talkingmouth "The contest was called the... hm..."
yellow @closedeyes angryeyebrows talkingmouth "I think it was called the [bluecolor]'Millennium Drop Water Festival Contest'{/color}?"

red @talkingmouth "Bit of a mouthful."

yellow @closedbrow talking2mouth "Yeah, they just called it the [bluecolor]Millennium Drop{/color}."

red @talkingmouth "Might be fun to watch."

yellow @talkingmouth "If you want, you can attend a Coordinator club meeting."
yellow @happy "Lisia calls them almost every other day. If there's not one today, there should be tomorrow."

red @closedbrow talking2mouth "Yeah, maybe I'll do that."
